This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Firebase onAuthStateChanged listener's inconsistent behavior. The `inconsistentAuth.js` file shows a scenario where the listener might fail to update the UI correctly, while `consistentAuth.js` provides a robust solution.  The issue is particularly noticeable under conditions of rapidly changing authentication status or when the app is backgrounded. The solution incorporates techniques to ensure that state changes are reliably handled and reflected in the application's UI.
