To reliably handle authentication state changes, use a combination of techniques:

1. **Debouncing:** Use a debounce function to prevent rapid calls to update the UI.
2. **Persistence:** Ensure you're using appropriate persistence options in Firebase to maintain state across app sessions.
3. **Error Handling:** Include comprehensive error handling within the listener to catch potential issues.
4. **State Management:** Employ a robust state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to centralize and manage authentication state. 

```javascript
//consistentAuth.js
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();
let debounceTimer;

function debounce(func, timeout = 300) {
  clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
  debounceTimer = setTimeout(func, timeout);
}

onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  debounce(() => {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in.
      console.log('User is signed in:', user);
    } else {
      // User is signed out.
      console.log('User is signed out.');
    }
  });
});
```
